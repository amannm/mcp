# Style

- High information density
- Flat organization
- Minimal dependencies
- Precision over convenience
- Immutable over mutable
- Composition over inheritance

# Wisdom

- Start from "ground truth" before trying something random
- Assume the most demanding interpretation when instructions are unclear
- Code in a self-documenting way, commenting only on tricky areas
- Make illegal states unrepresentable and valid operations obvious
- Implement external dependencies furthest from the center of a codebase

# Nits

- Write simple, typed, strict, idiomatic, standard, modern Java 24
- Avoid introducing `null` or `Object`
- Unchecked casts are unacceptable
- Use `instanceof` to simultaneously select types and reject `null`
- Use polymorphism/default/sentinels instead of `null`
- Avoid `java.lang.reflect` and `javax.annotation`
