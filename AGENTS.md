# Philosophy

- High information density
- Flat organization
- Minimal dependencies
- Precision over convenience
- Immutable over mutable
- Composition over inheritance

# Preferences

- Write typed, idiomatic, modern Java 24
- Leverage `instanceof` pattern matching
- Unchecked casts are unacceptable
- Avoid introducing `null` or `Object`
- Avoid `java.lang.reflect` and `javax.annotation`
- Avoid comments except for tricky areas (use self-documenting code)

# Wisdom

- Start from ground truth before trying something random
- Assume the most demanding interpretation when instructions are unclear
- Make illegal states unrepresentable and valid operations obvious
- Keep external dependencies furthest from the center of a codebase
- Don't waste time writing PR descriptions

# Miscellaneous

- `gradle` and `javap` are available in this environment
