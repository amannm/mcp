Servers MAY provide certificate utilities for development and testing. These
utilities generate key pairs, self-signed certificates, and certificate signing
requests (CSR) with Subject Alternative Name (SAN) support.

## Key Pair Generation

Implementations MUST support RSA 2048 and ECDSA P-256 key pairs.

## Self-Signed Certificates

Self-signed certificates **MUST** include:

- A subject distinguished name
- Subject Alternative Name entries
- A SHA-256 signature

## Certificate Signing Requests

CSR generation **MUST** include the subject distinguished name and requested
Subject Alternative Names.

## Export and Import

PEM encoding for certificates and CSRs **SHOULD** be supported.

## Validation

Self-signed certificates **SHOULD** be verified using their own public key and
validated for the current time.
