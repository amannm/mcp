Feature: MCP Integration Scenarios and Edge Cases
  As an MCP implementation
  I want to handle complex real-world scenarios and edge cases
  So that the system works reliably in production environments

  Background:
    Given a complete MCP implementation
    And all capabilities are supported

  @integration @complex-workflow
  Scenario: Multi-feature workflow integration
    Given server with resources, tools, and prompts
    And client with sampling, roots, and elicitation
    When client requests prompt with arguments
    Then server returns prompt with tool calls embedded
    When client processes prompt and calls tools
    Then tools may request sampling during execution
    And tools may access resources for context
    When sampling completes
    Then tool execution continues with LLM results
    And final tool output includes all context

  @integration @nested-operations
  Scenario: Deeply nested operation handling
    Given tool that performs complex multi-step operation
    When tool execution requires user input
    Then tool requests elicitation from client
    When elicitation triggers additional resource needs
    Then tool accesses additional resources
    When resource access requires LLM processing
    Then tool requests sampling for resource analysis
    When all nested operations complete
    Then tool returns comprehensive result

  @edge-cases @large-payloads
  Scenario: Large payload handling
    Given system configured for large payloads
    When client requests resource with 100MB content
    Then server handles large response appropriately
    And transport manages large data transfer
    When tool returns extensive structured data
    Then client processes large tool results
    And memory usage remains reasonable

  @edge-cases @high-frequency
  Scenario: High-frequency operation patterns
    Given system under high load
    When client makes 1000 rapid resource requests
    Then server handles burst efficiently
    And responses maintain quality and consistency
    When 100 concurrent tool executions occur
    Then server manages concurrency appropriately
    And resource usage remains stable

  @edge-cases @boundary-conditions
  Scenario Outline: Boundary condition handling
    Given system at <boundary_condition>
    When <operation> is performed
    Then system handles <expected_behavior>
    And maintains <system_property>

    Examples:
      | boundary_condition    | operation                  | expected_behavior        | system_property    |
      | memory limit          | large resource request     | graceful degradation     | memory stability   |
      | connection limit      | max concurrent connections | connection queueing      | service availability|
      | timeout boundary      | exactly timed operation    | precise timeout handling | timing accuracy    |
      | rate limit threshold  | burst of requests          | rate limiting activation | throughput control |

  @edge-cases @unicode-handling
  Scenario: Unicode and encoding edge cases
    Given resources with various character encodings
    When client requests resource with emoji content
    Then server returns properly encoded Unicode
    When tool arguments contain special characters
    Then server processes Unicode arguments correctly
    When sampling involves multilingual content
    Then all text processing handles Unicode properly

  @edge-cases @malformed-data
  Scenario: Malformed data resilience
    Given server receives malformed inputs
    When client sends resource URI with special characters
    Then server validates and sanitizes URI safely
    When tool receives arguments with invalid JSON
    Then server rejects with clear error message
    When sampling request has malformed content
    Then client validates and handles appropriately

  @state-management @session
  Scenario: Session state consistency
    Given long-running MCP session
    When multiple resources are subscribed
    Then subscription state is maintained consistently
    When capabilities change mid-session
    Then session adapts to new capability state
    When errors occur during state changes
    Then session state remains consistent

  @state-management @cleanup
  Scenario: Resource cleanup and lifecycle
    Given resources with subscriptions and progress tokens
    When operations complete or are cancelled
    Then associated resources are cleaned up
    When connection terminates unexpectedly
    Then both sides clean up orphaned resources
    When server restarts during operation
    Then client handles reconnection gracefully

  @performance @optimization
  Scenario: Performance optimization scenarios
    Given performance-critical deployment
    When frequent small resource requests occur
    Then server optimizes for low latency
    When bulk operations are needed
    Then batching optimizations are applied
    When caching is beneficial
    Then appropriate caching strategies are used

  @compatibility @versioning
  Scenario: Cross-version compatibility
    Given client with older protocol version
    And server with newer protocol version
    When version negotiation occurs
    Then compatible subset of features is used
    When new features are requested
    Then appropriate capability errors are returned
    When deprecated features are used
    Then backwards compatibility is maintained

  @transport @switching
  Scenario: Transport mechanism reliability
    Given MCP over multiple transport types
    When stdio transport is used
    Then process lifecycle is managed properly
    When HTTP transport is used
    Then connection pooling and keep-alive work
    When transport fails mid-operation
    Then appropriate error recovery occurs

  @security @penetration
  Scenario: Security penetration testing scenarios
    Given security-hardened MCP implementation
    When malicious resource URIs are provided
    Then path traversal attacks are prevented
    When oversized payloads are sent
    Then denial-of-service protection activates
    When injection attacks are attempted
    Then input validation prevents exploitation

  @reliability @fault-tolerance
  Scenario: Fault tolerance under adverse conditions
    Given unreliable network conditions
    When intermittent connectivity occurs
    Then operations retry with appropriate backoff
    When partial data corruption happens
    Then integrity checks detect and handle corruption
    When system resources are exhausted
    Then graceful degradation occurs

  @monitoring @observability
  Scenario: Monitoring and observability
    Given monitoring-enabled MCP deployment
    When operations are performed
    Then metrics are collected for performance
    When errors occur
    Then error rates and types are tracked
    When security events happen
    Then audit logs are generated appropriately

  @real-world @use-cases
  Scenario Outline: Real-world deployment scenarios
    Given MCP deployed in <deployment_context>
    When <typical_operation> is performed
    Then <performance_requirement> is met
    And <reliability_requirement> is satisfied

    Examples:
      | deployment_context | typical_operation      | performance_requirement | reliability_requirement |
      | IDE integration    | code resource access   | sub-100ms response      | 99.9% availability      |
      | chat application   | tool execution         | real-time processing    | graceful error handling |
      | automation system  | batch operations       | high throughput         | fault tolerance         |
      | research platform  | data analysis          | complex workflows       | audit trail             |

  @stress @testing
  Scenario: Stress testing scenarios
    Given system under extreme load
    When 10000 concurrent users access resources
    Then system maintains acceptable performance
    When memory pressure is high
    Then garbage collection and cleanup work effectively
    When CPU is saturated
    Then request prioritization functions correctly

  @regression @scenarios
  Scenario: Regression prevention scenarios
    Given previously identified edge cases
    When specific failure conditions are recreated
    Then fixes remain effective over time
    When system configurations change
    Then core functionality continues working
    When dependencies are updated
    Then MCP protocol compliance is maintained

  @compliance @standards
