Feature: MCP Performance Baseline Testing
  # Verifies performance characteristics and baseline metrics for MCP protocol
  As an MCP implementation
  I want to establish performance baselines and validate scalability
  So that I can ensure acceptable performance under various load conditions

  Background:
    Given a clean MCP environment
    And performance monitoring is enabled
    And baseline metrics are configured

  @ping @high-frequency
  Scenario: High-frequency ping operations
    # Tests ping performance under high-frequency operation loads
    # Establishes baseline for connection health monitoring overhead
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I send ping requests at high frequency:
      | frequency_hz | duration_seconds | expected_success_rate |
      | 1            | 60               | 100%                  |
      | 10           | 30               | 99%                   |
      | 100          | 10               | 95%                   |
      | 1000         | 5                | 90%                   |
    Then all ping responses should be received within acceptable latency
    And the success rate should meet or exceed expectations
    And connection stability should be maintained throughout the test
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
    And no resource leaks should be detected

  @ping @latency-baseline
  Scenario: Ping latency baseline measurement
    # Establishes baseline latency metrics for ping operations
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I measure ping latency over 1000 requests
    Then the median latency should be less than 5ms
    And the 95th percentile latency should be less than 20ms
    And the 99th percentile latency should be less than 50ms
    And no ping request should exceed 100ms
    And latency distribution should be consistent across test runs

  @resources @streaming
  Scenario: Large resource streaming
    # Tests performance of large resource transfer operations
    # Establishes baseline for bulk data transfer capabilities
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    And the server provides resources of various sizes
    When I stream large resources:
      | resource_size | transfer_method | expected_throughput |
      | 1MB           | single_request  | >10MB/s             |
      | 10MB          | single_request  | >50MB/s             |
      | 100MB         | chunked_stream  | >100MB/s            |
      | 1GB           | chunked_stream  | >200MB/s            |
    Then transfer should complete within expected time limits
    And throughput should meet or exceed baseline expectations
    And memory usage should remain bounded during transfer
    And connection should remain stable throughout large transfers
    And resource cleanup should occur promptly after transfer

  @resources @concurrent-access
  Scenario: Concurrent resource access
    # Tests resource access performance under concurrent load
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    And the server provides multiple resources for concurrent access
    When I access resources concurrently:
      | concurrent_clients | requests_per_client | resource_count |
      | 10                 | 100                 | 50             |
      | 50                 | 50                  | 100            |
      | 100                | 20                  | 200            |
    Then all resource requests should complete successfully
    And response times should remain within acceptable bounds
    And no resource access conflicts should occur
    And server should maintain stable performance across all clients
    And resource subscriptions should work correctly under concurrent load

  @tools @invocation-performance
  Scenario: Concurrent tool invocations
    # Tests tool invocation performance under concurrent load
    # Establishes baseline for tool execution scalability
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    And the server provides multiple tools for concurrent testing
    When I invoke tools concurrently:
      | concurrent_invocations | tool_execution_time | expected_completion_time |
      | 10                     | 100ms               | <500ms                   |
      | 50                     | 100ms               | <1000ms                  |
      | 100                    | 100ms               | <2000ms                  |
      | 500                    | 100ms               | <5000ms                  |
    Then all tool invocations should complete successfully
    And no tool invocation should timeout unexpectedly
    And tool execution isolation should be maintained
    And resource utilization should scale appropriately
    And tool result accuracy should not be compromised under load

  @tools @throughput-baseline
  Scenario: Tool invocation throughput baseline
    # Establishes baseline throughput metrics for tool invocations
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    And the server provides a lightweight test tool
    When I measure tool invocation throughput over 5 minutes:
      | measurement_period | target_throughput | measurement_accuracy |
      | 5_minutes          | >1000_ops/sec     | Â±5%                  |
    Then sustained throughput should meet baseline requirements
    And throughput should remain stable throughout measurement period
    And no performance degradation should occur over time
    And error rate should remain below 0.1%
    And resource usage should be predictable and bounded

  @protocol @message-throughput
  Scenario: Message throughput baseline
    # Tests overall protocol message processing throughput
    # Establishes baseline for general protocol scalability
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I send various message types at high throughput:
      | message_type   | messages_per_second | duration_seconds |
      | ping_requests  | 1000                | 30               |
      | tool_calls     | 500                 | 60               |
      | resource_reads | 200                 | 120              |
      | prompt_gets    | 100                 | 180              |
      | mixed_workload | 800                 | 300              |
    Then all messages should be processed within acceptable time limits
    And message processing latency should remain stable under load
    And no message should be lost or corrupted during high throughput
    And protocol overhead should remain minimal
    And connection should handle sustained high-throughput gracefully

  @protocol @scalability-limits
  Scenario: Protocol scalability limits
    # Tests protocol behavior at scalability limits
    # Establishes maximum supported load characteristics
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I gradually increase load until system limits are reached:
      | load_metric          | increment_step | expected_limit | degradation_threshold |
      | concurrent_clients   | 10             | >100           | <50% performance loss |
      | messages_per_sec     | 100            | >2000          | <50% performance loss |
      | active_subscriptions | 50             | >1000          | <50% performance loss |
      | resource_cache_size  | 100MB          | >1GB           | <50% performance loss |
    Then system should degrade gracefully approaching limits
    And clear error messages should indicate capacity limits
    And system should remain stable at maximum supported load
    And recovery should occur promptly when load decreases
    And no permanent performance degradation should result from peak load

  @memory @usage-baseline
  Scenario: Memory usage baseline
    # Establishes baseline memory usage patterns
    # Tests for memory leaks and excessive memory consumption
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I run sustained operations for extended periods:
      | operation_type     | duration_minutes | memory_growth_limit |
      | continuous_pings   | 30               | <10MB               |
      | resource_streaming | 60               | <50MB               |
      | tool_invocations   | 90               | <100MB              |
      | mixed_operations   | 120              | <200MB              |
    Then memory usage should remain within established baselines
    And no memory leaks should be detected
    And garbage collection impact should be minimal
    And memory usage should be proportional to active operations
    And memory should be released promptly after operations complete

  @error-recovery @performance-impact
  Scenario: Error recovery performance impact
    # Tests performance impact of error conditions and recovery
    Given I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I introduce various error conditions during high-load operations:
      | error_condition         | error_frequency | recovery_time_limit |
      | network_interruptions   | 1%              | <1s                 |
      | malformed_messages      | 0.1%            | <100ms              |
      | resource_unavailable    | 2%              | <500ms              |
      | tool_execution_failures | 1%              | <200ms              |
    Then error recovery should occur within specified time limits
    And overall system performance should not be significantly impacted
    And successful operations should continue during error recovery
    And error handling should not cause cascading failures
    And performance should return to baseline after error resolution

  @benchmarking @regression-detection
  Scenario: Performance regression detection
    # Compares current performance against historical baselines
    # Detects performance regressions across releases
    Given I have historical performance baseline data
    And I have an established MCP connection for performance testing
    When I run the standard performance benchmark suite
    Then current performance should meet or exceed historical baselines:
      | metric                     | baseline_value | acceptable_variance |
      | ping_latency_p95           | 20ms           | Â±20%                |
      | tool_invocation_throughput | 1000_ops/sec   | Â±15%                |
      | resource_transfer_rate     | 100MB/s        | Â±25%                |
      | concurrent_client_limit    | 100            | Â±10%                |
      | memory_usage_baseline      | 200MB          | Â±30%                |
    And any performance regressions should be clearly identified
    And regression impact should be quantified and documented
    And recommendations for performance optimization should be provided
